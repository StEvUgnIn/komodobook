# Mastering Komodo

Mastering Komodo is a book for developers, although the first two chapters cover komodo at a level that is also approachable to non-programmers. Anyone with a basic understanding of technology can read the first two chapters to get a great understanding of komodo.

This repository contains the very first draft of the book.
